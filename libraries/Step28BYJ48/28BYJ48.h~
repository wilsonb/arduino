  28BYJ48.h - Library for Controlling Stepper Motor 28BYJ-48 with
  a ULN2003A driver chip.

  The 28BYJ-48 motor is a 4-phase, 8-beat motor, geared down by
  a factor of 68. One bipolar winding is on motor pins 1 & 3 and
  the other on motor pins 2 & 4. The step angle is 5.625/64 and the 
  operating Frequency is 100pps. Current draw is 92mA.

  28BYJ-48 has the following wiring configuration:

  1. Blue Wire - Control Pin 1		1 ----|
  2. Pink Wire - Control Pin 2		   5V-|   M
  3. Yellow Wire - Control Pin 3	3 ----| _____
  4. Orange Wire - Control Pin 4	       |  |  |
  5. Red Wire - 5-12 VDC		       2 5V  4	

  Each stepper motor is connected to a ULN2003A chip with the following
  pinout:
	     ___
	 IN1|   |OUT1 - Blue
